- The Fundamental building block of real world javascripts application  are called Function.
- Functions are the piece of code which can be used over and over again in our code.

To Declare Function 

```bash
function logger() {
    console.log('My name is Sijan');
}
```

Here , The line ‘My name is Sijan’  can be used multiple time. So we will used this code. 

To use the function also called as runnig/ calling / invoking  the function.

```bash
function logger() {
    console.log('My name is Sijan');
}

logger();
logger();
logger();
logger();

```

Here I have use function “ logger() ; “  four time so “ My name is Sijan “ now will be printed four a time.

Example 

Let imagine the fruit processor and processor ;process which is called function  and in the end  it became juice.

- Here in a first line of code apples, oranges are called parameters.

```bash
function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
    console.log(apples, oranges);
    const juice = `Juice with ${apples} apples and ${oranges} oranges.`;
    return juice;
}

const applesJuice = fruitProcessor(5, 0);
console.log(applesJuice);
console.log(fruitProcessor(5, 0));
```

We can use with different input value to get different output.

```bash
function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
    const juice = `Juice with ${apples} apples and ${oranges} oranges.`;
    return juice;
}

const applesJuice = fruitProcessor(5, 0);
console.log(applesJuice);

const appleOranageJuice = fruitProcessor(2, 4);
console.log(appleOranageJuice);
```

### Function allow us to write more  maintable code because from the function we can create, reuse the code again and again all time.

### Very important  principle writing clean code use in programming and this principle is called Don’t Repeat YourSelf Or “DRY”

- Function that we used to convert string to number

```bash
const num = Number('19')
```

To check go to  console   and type num. Output will be appeared as Number you have put. For eg i have put 19.
